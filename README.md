# cactbot-chat

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/quisquous/cactbot-chat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/quisquous/cactbot-chat)

A very unofficial cactbot module to display party chat in a browser window.

The idea is to either hide chat entirely (via textools?)
or to make it as invisible as possible in game, so as to avoid the need
for a giant chat blocker image.

Not intended for general use, but patches welcome.
